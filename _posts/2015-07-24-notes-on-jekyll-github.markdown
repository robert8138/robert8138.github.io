# Resources

* To build a Jekyll project, simply follow the instruction on [jekyllrb.com]

The basic commands are relatively simple

{% highlight python %}
gem install jekyll
jekyll new my-new-awesome-website
cd my-new-awesome-website
jekyll serve --watch
{% endhighlight %}


* The awesome thing about Jekyll is that a lot of people already pre-built different themes that you can use directly. Here are a few examples

  * [Artist's Theme] from Devtips. This one is pretty fancy, and has interactivity, and is more tailored for designers
  * [Poole] Very minimalistic look
  * [Jekyll Bootstrap Themes] Various Twitter Bootstrap themes


* I also found the following [YouTube] video to be helpful to get started. Allegedly, this is the most viewed Jekyll/Github video I can find on YouTube on this topic.


* You can totally just copy the jekyll directory into your githubUserName.github.io, push the changes, and the site would totally work under this domain. Here is [mine] as an example.
