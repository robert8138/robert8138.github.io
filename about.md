American mind, Taiwanese heart, World view. I am currently a Data Scientist at [Twitter](http://twitter.com), working on the experimentation team. Before working on experimentation, I have been working as a product data scientist on the Twitter Growth team.

I did my Undergraduate Studies at UC Berkeley, and a MS degree in Statistics from Stanford. I have a broad interest in Statistics, Operations Research, Economics, Machine Learning, and Computer Science.
